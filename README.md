# Kumbh : An Android Application
The globally used google-map is a very interactive application which provides an efficient map along with the real-time information about the traffic on the roads or streets and offers brief information about the neighbourhood areas of that particular place in various aspects like medical shops, restaurants, tourist spots, hotels and etc. But it does not provide the exact real-time condition of the road whether it is closed for construction for a particular duration or any instantaneous incidents like road accidents, bridge or flyover collapsed and other issues which are essential information for passengers and pedestrians. So here, for a specific place or area we are implementing such a map providing all such information in real-time through a mobile application. These all kind of information are acquired from the local traffic controllers and supplied to the admin of this application. On the basis of those information the map is updated manually in real-time with user understandable specific interacted manners.
