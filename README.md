# Kumbh : An Android Application
The globally used google-map is a very interactive application that provides an efficient map along with real-time information about the traffic on the roads or streets. The map also offers brief information about the neighbourhood areas of that particular place in various aspects like medical shops, restaurants, tourist spots, hotels, etc. But it does not provide the exact real-time condition of the road, such as whether it is closed for construction for a particular duration or any instantaneous incidents like road accidents, bridge or flyover collapsed, and other issues which are essential information for passengers and pedestrians. So here, for a specific place or area we are implement a map that provides all such information in real-time through a mobile application. The information are acquired from the local traffic controllers and supplied to the administrator of this application. On the basis of those information, the map is manually updated in real-time for use by the users of the map.
